## Developing an Open Source Plasma Simulation Environment in MOOSE

**Project Description** The MOOSE framework is an open source finite element framework that allows developers to quickly write large-scale multiphysics simulations. Applications developed within the framework are natively scalable. 

CRANE is a fully open-source plasma chemistry software that may be used to solve chemical reaction networks of arbitrary size. Reactions may be added in a human-readable format, allowing large lists of reactions to be added with ease. Electron-impact reactions
